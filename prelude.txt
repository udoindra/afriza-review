This month the Indonesia's goverment lead by the timid and placid SBY as the zigzag leader decided to raise the price of petroleum oil for its people. Despite the movement that against it, from the academic students  and the oppose party, the raise is still down to go this month. Facing the holy month of Ramadhan, where prices tends to go up to reach heaven, the raise still be implemented this month. May God help us all.
