A very short conversation with Hanna Fransisca

Hanna Fransisca is a very busy person. She's a mother, a wive, a working woman, an active college student, socialite, literature maecenas, motivator, and last but definitely not the least: a poet. Having two collection of poetry book, which one of them ('Konde Penyair Han') had won the prestigious award as the favorite poetry book from Tempo magazine, she had laid her claws nicely in Indonesian poetry landscape. On a warm midnight in June 2013, Afriza Review had managed to slip in her busy schedule to sneak a short conversation via online chat.

<b>AFREV</b><br/>what is the pleasure of poetry (to you)?

<b>Hanna</b><br/>it's hard to explain. There's some kind of soul fulfillment, some kind of solitude, some kind of beauty that's hard to explain.

<b>AFREV</b><br/>Since when you know poetry?

<b>Hanna</b><br/>Ever since childhood.

<b>AFREV</b><br/>Is there anyone that introduced it, or... did you found out yourself?

<b>Hanna</b><br/>The 'Tionghoa' culture is full with poetry, so indirectly I've been in contact with poetry since childhood.

<b>AFREV</b><br/>I see... whose poetry that first attract your attention and the first ones that you like?

<b>Hanna</b><br/>Classical Chinese poems. In elementary school there's Chairil Anwar's poems. Amir Hamzah poems. Classical Chinese poets that's legendary: Li Bai, Du Fu, Wang Wei, Su Shi, and the kinds of them...

<b>AFREV</b><br/>Wang Wei, is there any poems of him that still linger in your head right trough this moment?<br/><i>*the interviewer is fond also of Wang Wei poems, so came those sudden question.*</i>

<b>Hanna</b><br/>Yes, there is, but in Mandarin language...

<i>*before we had the chance to ask her to recite the Wang Wei poem, she suddenly ask us permission to leave the chat because she still has to work on her campus paper and so we part. Every effort to continue the conversation later on are block by her busy schedule. So we realy appreciate this short opportunity that we had.*</i>
