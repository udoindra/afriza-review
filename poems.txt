SIGN
<br/>
<i>Dedicated to: Ferdinand de Saussure</i>
<br/>
Morning without sign is nothingness
Stack of sounds inside the brain
Empty glances in hurried pace
Heading to somewhere of nowhere
<br/>
Desperately floating to evening come
<br/>
Evening without signs is meaningless
Wearied corpse that refusing to sleep
Embracing the freeze of the cold hours
A patient waiting for your fart,
Love.

<b>Love On Sidewalk</b>
<br/>
We are the marginal aspect
of the horizon
Surfacing on the balance
Occurences
Only sidewalk dominate our view
<br/>
My dear, hold me tighter
We only have each other..
<br/>
And then we talk, wait,..
Hearken..
Do you hear the tunes in flight,
As we spoken?
Feel the accoustic heaven,
Flown in mid-air!
<br/>
To the sky, dear..
See our trouble scatters in the atmosphere!
<br/>
Let's chart the dreamland
While we're awake
Making ilustration
Of halucination
And happy thoughts
As a schematic ideas to win
The spirit of prophetic
Revelation
<br/>
To face the awakening of
LOVE.

<b>The Anatomy of Sleep</b>
<br/>
Death miniature stalls the time
The while that shoo weights, pain, sorrows
<br/>
An angel with cherubim cheek
Came kisses my forehead -writhes
<br/>
Sometimes a witch, yet
Beautifully played by Gong Li
<br/>
Traces of day builds the structure
Or what's left of memories wasted
<br/>
To sculp the self upon awaken
Hang on to past lamentation and hope.

<b>Dandy Warholla's Umbrella</b>
<br/>
Maybe the rain shall pour later on
Soon, perhaps
While waiting let's see some dreams
Then weave it to delays,
Curses, and cusses
Routine:
A terrifying monster.
<br/>
But there's a man
Open his umbrella before hand
Not waiting for signs from the sky
Doesn't postpones while sucking poppies
Is he the last boyscout alert?
<br/>
"Nope, I am a freelance driver
The day is hot and I want to stay..."
He answer so boldly,
While taking pictures of surrounding air.
