I wrote this review piece in Chusnato's (my best friend) so-called '5 Minutes Writing' style. It emphasizes on what lies in your stream of consciousness then just let it out, without even the slightest editing before all thought and ideas ended in approximately 5 minutes time. Then it's... the end.

Mr. Pouls (an avid reader of our ouvres) gave his usual sweet-yet-kinda-hyperbolic remarks when he read it. "Whooaa.. you can make this... like in 5 minutes? I wonder what happen in an hour...?".

"Eternity," I answered, jocundly.
