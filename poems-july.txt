Selected Poems of Udo Indra

<b>SIGN</b>
 
<i>Dedicated to: Ferdinand de Saussure</i>
 
Morning without sign is nothingness
Stack of sounds inside the brain
Empty glances in hurried pace
Heading to somewhere of nowhere
 
Desperately floating to evening come
 
Evening without signs is meaningless
Wearied corpse that refusing to sleep
Embracing the freeze of the cold hours
A patient waiting for your fart,
Love.

<b>Love On Sidewalk</b>
 
We are the marginal aspect
of the horizon
Surfacing on the balance
Occurences
Only sidewalk dominate our view
 
My dear, hold me tighter
We only have each other..
 
And then we talk, wait,..
Hearken..
Do you hear the tunes in flight,
As we spoken?
Feel the accoustic heaven,
Flown in mid-air!
 
To the sky, dear..
See our trouble scatters in the atmosphere!
 
Let's chart the dreamland
While we're awake
Making ilustration
Of halucination
And happy thoughts
As a schematic ideas to win
The spirit of prophetic
Revelation
 
To face the awakening of
LOVE.

<b>The Anatomy of Sleep</b>
 
Death miniature stalls the time
The while that shoo weights, pain, sorrows
 
An angel with cherubim cheek
Came kisses my forehead -writhes
 
Sometimes a witch, yet
Beautifully played by Gong Li
 
Traces of day builds the structure
Or what's left of memories wasted
 
To sculp the self upon awaken
Hang on to past lamentation and hope.

<b>Dandy Warholla's Umbrella</b>
 
Maybe the rain shall pour later on
Soon, perhaps
While waiting let's see some dreams
Then weave it to delays,
Curses, and cusses
Routine:
A terrifying monster.
 
But there's a man
Open his umbrella before hand
Not waiting for signs from the sky
Doesn't postpones while sucking poppies
Is he the last boyscout alert?
 
"Nope, I am a freelance driver
The day is hot and I want to stay..."
He answer so boldly,
While taking pictures of surrounding air.
